As someone who is not a fan of frameworks yet found themselves building the same core constructs every time I started a new project: I decided to put these ideas into something that made it easier for me to be consistent across projects. The output turned out to be more of a means of managing ETL semantically within a stateful application than a framework.

Semantic | *The core construct behind Continuum is a `domain`. A domain is simply a semantic way to group a first-class entity of your application. Such as a users domain or a vehicles domain.*
