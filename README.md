## Captain's Log

As someone who is not a fan of frameworks yet found themselves building the same core constructs every time I started a new project: I decided to put these ideas into something that made it easier for me to be consistent across projects. The output turned out to be more of a means of managing ETL semantically within a stateful application than a framework.

**Concepts**

Concept | Description
--- | ---
Semantic | *The core construct behind Continuum is a `domain`. A domain is simply a semantic way to group a first-class entity of your application. Such as a users domain or a vehicles domain.* Learn more.
ETL | *Continuum was designed to make ETL in JS apps simpler and robust.*
Abstract | *The abstractions have been designed in a way that should enable you to use what components you feel necessary.*
Conventions | *The structures of Continuum seek to provide consistency in the way our code can be organized and abstracted.*
